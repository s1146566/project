This directory contains a simple MD code

This program implements:
    long range inverse square forces between particles. F = G * m1*m2 / r**2
    viscosity term     F = -u V
If 2 particles approach closer than Size we flip the direction of the
interaction force to approximate a collision.


This program was developed as part of a code optimisation course
and is therefore deliberately inefficient.


The code is available in C and Fortran. You only need to look at one version 
of the code.

The program reads input.dat and writes output.dat.

The directory Test contains source of a program to compare output.dat files.
It will only report differences above a preset tolerance value.
